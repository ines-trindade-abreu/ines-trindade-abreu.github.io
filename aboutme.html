        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
		<p>
            I grew up in the Lisbon suburbs, always excited by learning -- whether in sports, languages, or sciences. Teachers often said I would struggle to choose just one path, and true to form, I embraced the challenge by pursuing STEM in high school, despite a natural proclivity for languages and the humanities.
        </p>

     	<p>
            Discovering astrophysics midway through high school was transformative. Driven to expand my horizons, I participated in the Fulbright/EducationUSA Competitive College Club program, in partnership with the Luso-American Foundation for Development, earning admission and a Presidential scholarship to Hofstra University's Honors College Class of 2021 in New York. Despite academic success there, practical financial realities brought me back to Portugal and led me to Técnico, Portugal's leading STEM institute.
        </p>

		<p>
            Returning to Portugal brought new opportunities, but also significant personal challenges. My journey has been shaped by struggles with physical and mental health, grief, and the ongoing search for self-knowledge and academic direction. Navigating these obstacles has taught me resilience and helped me clarify my true interests, both in science and beyond.
		</p>
		<p>
            I am now wrapping up my BSc and MS in Engineering Physics simultaneously, specializing in nuclear and radiation physics with applications to astrophysics and health sciences.
		</p>
