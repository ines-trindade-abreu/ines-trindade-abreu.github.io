        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
		<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Lisbon, Portugal. As a child, I pursued a number of interests and activities, including various sports and cultural activities. I enjoyed learning and liked all subjects in elementary and middle school, and was warned by my teachers that I might have a hard time choosing what I'd like to pursue later on. I ended up choosing STEM in High School.
        </p>

     	<p>Halfway through High School, I discovered the incredible world of Astrophysics. I was instantly drawn to it, and began researching opportunities to study abroad in University (at the time, the educational offer in Portugal was very limited and I had always dreamt of studying abroad). I was admitted to a Fulbright program in 2016, designed to help students apply to US universities successfully, the Competitive College Club. There were fourteen students from the whole country participating in the first phase of the program that year. During the Summer of 2016, I was awarded one of five grants available through a partnership with the LAFD (Luso-American Foundation for Development), to help cover the testing and application fees.
        </p>

		<p>I was admitted to Hofstra University's Class of 2021, with a Presidential Scholarship, and I attended Hofstra for a year, during which I made it to the Dean's List on both semesters. Due to lack of additional funding and financial hardship (the wage gap between Portugal and the US is quite significant), I returned to Portugal, where I was able to enroll in the Engineering Physics program at Técnico Lisboa, one of the highest-rated programs in the entire country. 
		</p>
		<p>I've been at Técnico ever since, exploring many subjects throughout my degree and finding out exactly what I am passionate about. I'm currently wrapping up my BSc degree and pursuing my MSc at the same time, so it is an exciting, albeit busy time!
		</p>
